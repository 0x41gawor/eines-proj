  <i>POX based SDN/OpenFlow controller</i>

This repository contains solution to the "QoS routing with SDN" project of the course ["EINES - Intellignet Network Systems"](https://zsut.tele.pw.edu.pl) realized during the summer semester of 2023 on the Warsaw University of Technology. The goal of the project was to get familiar with [Software Defined Networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking) and [OpenFlow Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow). The actual problem description can be found in [eines-project1-description.pdf](eines-project1-description.pdf). The network topology was created with [Mininet](http://mininet.org) and the OpenFlow Controller was created via [Pox networking software platform](https://github.com/noxrepo/pox).

Our solution, "*Dzienciol.py*" is the POX component, that implements functionalities required in the project.
