We have flows:
H1-H4
H1-H5
H1-H6
H2-H4
H2-H5
H2-H6
H3-H4
H3-H5
H3-H6
Intent says how the flows should be routed
Policy is to e.g. load balance the network

First you know the flow will appear, you set up the switches, and then the flow goes. There is not some magic with PACKET_IN/PACKET_OUT stuff etc. the controller is not reactive to be easy

Intents can be hardcoded into python script (controlled code?)
controller can read some text files
manual commands are fine

ok, so new intent appears/is generated and it feeds controller with new information and controller takes some action based on it

you can assume the duration of flow lifetime is inifinite

you can reject the intent or accept it and then allocate it with respect of network policies

The teaching point of the proj is that we translate some high level intent into some low level decisions
